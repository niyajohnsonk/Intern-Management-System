# Intern-Management-System


## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to apply programming knowledge to make an Intern Management database which will enable the user to perform the following tasks:

1. Retrieve information for the résumé

2. Show candidates eligible to be hired.

3. Add information of a new intern into the database

4. Update the progress in the project assigned to the intern.

5. Show the information of all the interns present.

## Project Description
Making software to keep track of all interns who have recently joined a company is the major aim of this project. Complete control over one's workforce is beneficial. Therefore, this project was created to make it simpler for a mentor to monitor the interns. Python code includes comments detailing the purposes of the key statements to make the program easier to understand.

This program is based on displaying information that the company is needed to provide in order to assist the intern in retrieving a résumé, hire an intern on a permanent basis, add the information of a new intern, update the status of the project that was allocated to the intern and lastly, display all the details of all the interns currently working in the company.

## Future Implementation
1. The intern management system enables the employer to retrieve the necessary information when an intern requests documentation from them for their résumé.

2. It also enables the company to view the eligible candidates, the candidates who may be eligible to be hired, and those interns who cannot be hired by looking at the effectiveness or progress of the project that was assigned to them to work on. This is useful when the company wants to permanently hire the intern and give him/her a full-time job.

3. If necessary, the intern management system can update the database with the information regarding a newly hired intern.

4. The intern management system also allows the company to keep an eye on the progress of the project assigned to the intern.

5. It allows the firm to see all of the current interns' information.
